I’m Gilad -  a self-taught software engineer (and startup founder).

Bio:
- Got my start by figuring out how to install FreeBSD 2.2 on my 486DX2 using 3.5” floppies
- Joined a small telco company, built an embedded Linux-MIPS DSL access multiplexer to provide broadband access to hotel rooms
- Became one of the first employees at Fabrix systems - built distributed video storage/streaming solutions, company got acquired for 100M
- Ended up being a Solutions Architect for Ericsson, traveled the world, and sold software  
- Built my own startup from scratch, raised VC money (used WP/Shopify for eComm, GCP/Firestore backend w/ Hybrid iOS/Android Frontend. BLE-based hardware.)

Preferences: 
- Love working as part of a close-knit engineering/product team
- Have been part of multiple teams, from the early days to the acquisition and beyond
- A self-proclaimed generalist, experience with front and back-end development
- Stack of choice these days is NodeJS/Typescript/NoSQL/GCP or AWS, but will always pick the right tool for the job
- Thrive under pressure, and have done so multiple times (and have the stories to tell)
- Take pride in ownership and going 0-1, iterating and making things happen
- Endless fascination with the latest frameworks, APIs and technologies
- Have been through multiple startups and know what NOT to do
